# SkyComp - Grade 11 Practical Assessment Task (PAT)

This project is a desktop application designed to manage and run knockout-style tournaments. It serves as a comprehensive planner for event organisers to create events, manage participants, and track results in real-time, while also providing a portal for participants to view their performance history.

## Features

### üõ†Ô∏è Organiser

* **Secure Authentication:** Create a new account or log in via email, password, and CAPTCHA.
* **Event Management:** Start a new tournament or continue managing a previously created event.
* **Participant Management:** Register new participants (with name, gender, DOB) into the database or select existing participants for an event.
* **Data Entry:** Enter qualification times to seed the top 8 participants into the knockout bracket.
* **Live Tournament Bracket:** View a visual representation of the tournament (Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Finals) that updates as round times are entered.
* **Results Capture:** Enter times for each knockout round to automatically advance winners.
* **Database Management:** Edit participant details (name, DOB, etc.) or event details directly from the organiser panel.
* **Leaderboard Generation:** Output a final leaderboard as a text file once the tournament is complete.

### üë§ Participant

* **Secure Login:** Authenticate using a unique **ParticipantID** and CAPTCHA.
* **View Personal Details:** Check personal information (name, gender, DOB) stored in the system (read-only).
* **View Past Results:** Access a historical log of all events participated in and the results/times achieved in each.

## Application Forms

The application is built around seven main forms:

* **frmLogin:** Authenticates Organisers (email/password) or Participants (ParticipantID). Includes CAPTCHA validation.
* **frmCreateAccount:** Allows new Organisers to register a new account with validation.
* **frmSelectEvent:** Prompts the Organiser to either start a new event or select an existing one to continue.
* **frmSelectParticipants:** An interface for Organisers to add new participants to the database or select at least 8 registered participants for the current event.
* **frmQualification:** A screen for the Organiser to input the qualification times for all selected participants.
* **frmOrganiser:** The main dashboard for event management, featuring two tabs:
    * **Edit Tab:** Allows for viewing, searching, sorting, and updating participant and event data.
    * **View Tab:** Displays the live tournament bracket, captures round-by-round results, and generates the final leaderboard.
* **frmParticipant:** A read-only screen for Participants to view their personal details and a grid of their past event results.
